This is an example app to demo the frontend and backend error monitoring capabilities of the Highlight Next.js SDK. You can check out our [docs](https://docs.highlight.run/nextjs-sdk) to learn more!

## Getting Started
You can get this demo up and running on Vercel in 2 steps:
1. [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhighlight-run%2Fnextjs-highlight-demo)
2. Install the [Highlight integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/highlight). You may need to redeploy your Vercel project for the new environment variables to be deployed.

After installing the Highlight integration, you can monitor your sessions and errors in [Highlight](https://app.highlight.run).

If you would like to run this sample app on another platform, or install the Highlight Next.js SDK on your own app, you can follow the getting started guide [here](https://docs.highlight.run/nextjs-sdk)
